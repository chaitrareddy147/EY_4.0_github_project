       <p align="justify"> Bharatanatyam, one of the oldest classical dance forms of India originating from Tamil Nadu, is renowned for its intricate movements, expressive gestures, and vibrant storytelling. The costume of Bharatanatyam is designed to enhance the dancer’s movements and highlight the geometric patterns and poses characteristic of the dance. Female dancers traditionally wear a sari, usually made of silk, which is draped in a unique style with pleats in the front that fan out gracefully during dance poses. The blouse is fitted, and the sari is often brightly colored with contrasting borders, creating a striking visual effect. Male dancers wear a dhoti with a fitted upper garment or angavastram, allowing freedom of movement while maintaining traditional aesthetics. Both male and female dancers adorn themselves with elaborate temple-style jewelry, including necklaces, earrings, bangles, armlets, waist belts, and ankle bells (ghungroo), which emphasize rhythmic footwork. The head is decorated with flowers and a traditional hairpiece, often including a sun-and-moon ornament on the forehead, while subtle makeup highlights the eyes and facial expressions essential for storytelling. Overall, the Bharatanatyam costume is a harmonious combination of elegance, tradition, and functionality, designed to complement the dynamic and expressive nature of the dance.
