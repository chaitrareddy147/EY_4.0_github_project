   <h1><b>KATHAKALI</b></h1>
   
    <p align="justify">
           <span style="color:red; font-size:200%;">K</span>athakali is a traditional form of Indian Classical Dance, and one of the most complex forms of Indian theatre. It is native to the Malayalam-speaking state of Kerala and is almost entirely practiced by Malayali people.It is a play of verses. These verses are called Kathakali literature or Attakatha. Mostly played in the courts of kings and temple festivals. Hence it is known as suvarna art forms. This performance uses the navarasas from the Natya Shastra text, authored by sage Bharata. Makeup and costumes are unique and large. It represents one of Kerala's traditional theater artforms. Kathakali is closely related to a more ancient theater artform of Kerala called Koodiyattam which is the only surviving specimen of the ancient Sanskrit theatre, thought to have originated around the beginning of the common era, and is officially recognized by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

        The costume of a Kathakali dancer is elaborate and highly symbolic, reflecting the grandeur of this classical dance-drama from Kerala, India. The most striking feature is the headgear, which consists of large, ornate crowns made of wood and gold foil, with different styles representing gods, demons, kings, or sages. Face makeup is equally elaborate, using natural pigments and rice paste to convey character types: green for noble heroes, red and black for villains, red for demons, and black for hunters or forest dwellers. White borders called chutti frame the face to accentuate expressions. The costume layers include heavily embroidered jackets and multi-layered skirts that form a bell-shaped silhouette, complemented by gold-colored ornaments such as necklaces, armlets, and bracelets. Hand and foot accessories, including ankle bells, highlight the dancer’s intricate movements, while props like swords or shields may be carried according to the role. Overall, the Kathakali costume is designed to be dramatic, colorful, and larger-than-life, allowing the performer to convey emotions and stories vividly to the audience.</p> 

      <p align="justify"> The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures–all of which are part of Indian classical dances including Kathakali. Dance and performance arts, states this ancient Hindu text,are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.</p> 

       <p align="justify"> The roots of Kathakali are unclear. Jones and Ryan state it is more than 500 years old. Kathakali emerged as a distinct genre of performance art during the 16th and 17th centuries in Kerala.The roots of Kathakali, states Mahinder Singh, are more ancient and some 1500 years old.</p>
